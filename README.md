Project 2: Correlation and Image Registration

The purpose of this project is to have you getting familiar with an important image processing topic, image registration.
So far, you have accomplished homework on rigid-body motion in project 1, i.e, you can move an image around. 
This is actually one of basic foundations in image registration.
Therefore, we will first define a measurement of how two images are similar to each other. We can pick one image as target, and the other one as the image object to be registered.
You can use such a measure as a guideline so that you can tell whether or not two images have been aligning when you move the object toward to the target. The higher the correlation is, the more two images are registered.
